I have been graduated Bauman MSTU. My specialization is radar systems. From the first year of education, i worked in telecom industry. At univesity i was interested in GNNS systems and math statistics. Since 2013, I was participated in a student project to build a race car - "Formula Student". In my diploma work described precise RTK positioning and telemetry system of a racecar. Now i am interesting in machine learning and attemt at different competitions. Also i attend ML course (Data mining in action - MIPT).

As for my hobbies, I am fond of karting and motorsport engineering.
