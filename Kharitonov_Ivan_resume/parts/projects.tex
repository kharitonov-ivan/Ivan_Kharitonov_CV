\textbf{Multiple object tracking toolbox} (\href{https://github.com/neer201/Multi-Object-Tracking-for-Automotive-Systems-in-python}{github}) \hfill 2021-current

Created a Python library for object tracking based on random finite sets.\\
\textbf{Race telemetry toolbox} \textit{(contract work)} \hfill 2021
\par
Developed a service that collects data from all cars and racetracks at the annual racecar championship to ensure fairness among competitors. The service calculates metrics and provides a visualization that aids in determining the necessary weight handicap, tyre, chassis, and powertrain settings for each car.
