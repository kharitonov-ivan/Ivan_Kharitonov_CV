\textbf{Agents trajectory prediction and Scene understanding} \textit{(Prediction)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lead group of people which working on ML-based agent trajectory prediction. Developed pipeline of project, wrote tests, provided code-review.
    \item Implemented physical, seq-to-seq, generative models that incorporates hd map use and deals with uncertanity by consider multi modal distribution.
    \item In-house dataset: Developed a library for use in training agent trajectory prediction models. Gathering data from raw source (logs for more 1 year period) and preparing dataset.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multi-object tracking} \textit{(Prediction)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analysis of several methods from literature and finding a suitable solution, namely solving object tracking problem using random finite set statistics. Developed a python library with multi-object tracking algorithms, motion and measurement models, and test scenarios. Consulting a team and sharing concepts of this task.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3D Object detection} (\textit{Perception})
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemeneted ROS2 node for object detection task based on point-cloud data stream from LIDARs.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Other}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organized weekly research papers reading seminars. Ideas from these seminars found themselves in the production models.
\end{itemize}
