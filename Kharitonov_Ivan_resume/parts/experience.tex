\textbf{Agents trajectory prediction and Scene understanding} \textit{(Prediction)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lead a team on ML-based agent trajectory prediction. Developed a project pipeline, testing, code-review.
    \item Implemented physical, seq-to-seq, generative models that incorporate hd map use and deal with uncertainty by considering multi modal distribution.
    \item In-house dataset: Developed a library for use in training agent trajectory prediction models. Gathering data from raw source.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multi-object tracking} \textit{(Prediction)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analysis of several methods from the literature and finding a suitable solution for, object tracking problem using random finite set statistics. Developed a python library with multi-object tracking algorithms, motion and measurement models, and test scenarios. Consulting a team and sharing concepts of this task.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3D Object detection} (\textit{Perception})
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented a ROS2 node for object detection based on point-cloud data stream from LIDARs.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Other}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organized weekly research papers reading seminars. Ideas from these seminars used in the production models later.
\end{itemize}
