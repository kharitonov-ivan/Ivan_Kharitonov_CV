\begin{itemize}
    \item Prediction: \textbf{agent trajectory prediction} using ML - full-cycle development from scratch
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[--] researching, implement physical-based, seq2seq and generative-based models
              \item[--] in-house dataset: gathering data from raw source and preparing dataset
              \item[--] writing tests, CI, provide code review and setup deployment
          \end{itemize}
    \item Multi-object tracking: Analysis of several methods from literature and finding a suitable solution - solve object tracking problem using random finite set statistics. Developed python library with multi-object tracking algorithms and test scenarios. Consulting team and share concepts of this task.
    \item Perception: Added models to the pipeline for point-cloud based object detection task.
    \item Other activity: Organize weekly research papers reading seminars. Several ideas from these seminars found themselves in the production models.
