I am a research engineer. My background is widespread from control systems for hydraulic actuators to generative models using DL for trajectory prediction. Now I worked on the self-driving project and I love this area. Also, I am a teaching assistant in the reinforcement learning course. I seek a research/software engineer position connected with deep learning. I am interested in self-driving and robotics areas and have a lot of experience with it.
