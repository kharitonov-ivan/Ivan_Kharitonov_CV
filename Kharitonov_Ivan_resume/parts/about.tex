I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in the automotive industry,
mostly in research teams. I have an extensive background in control
systems and DL models. Now I am a senior engineer in a self-driving project and lead the small ML group. Likewise, I am a teaching assistant
in a reinforcement learning course. I'm seeking a research/software engineer
position connected with deep learning, especially in autonomous driving or
robotics applications.
