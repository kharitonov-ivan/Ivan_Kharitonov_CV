I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in the automotive industry,
mostly in research teams. I have an extensive background in working with control
systems and modern DL models. Now I am working on the self-driving project as a
senior engineer and lead the small ML group. Likewise, I am a teaching assistant
in the reinforcement learning course. I'm seeking a research/software engineer
position connected with deep learning, especially in autonomous driving or
robotics applications.
