I hold a M.Sc degree in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Machine Learning. With 5 years of experience in software development, I've spent 2 years working on Control Systems and 3 years in Automotive driving, gaining experience in Lidar-based object detection, computer vision, multiple object tracking, and motion prediction using deep learning techniques. I've also spent a year in a technical leadership role, and currently serve as a teaching assistant for a reinforcement learning course. Now, to broaden my professional horizons, I am in the process of applying for a Global Talent Visa in the UK.
