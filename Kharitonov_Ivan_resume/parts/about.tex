I hold a M.Sc degree in Electrical Engineering, with an additional specialization in Machine Learning. With 5 years of experience in software development, I have spent 2 years working on Control Systems and 3 years in Automotive driving, including experience with Lidar-based object detection, computer vision, multiple object tracking, and motion prediction using deep learning techniques. Additionally, I have a year of experience in a technical leadership role and currently serve as a teaching assistant for a reinforcement learning course. I am now seeking a research or software engineering position focused on deep learning, specifically in the areas of autonomous driving or robotics.
