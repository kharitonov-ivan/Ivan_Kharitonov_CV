\project
{Motion trajectory prediction}
{Lead a team (5 ppl) in developing an ML-based agent trajectory prediction project pipeline, overseeing testing and code reviews. Organized weekly research paper review seminars, incorporating ideas from these sessions into final models.}
{Improve metrics for trajectory predictions by 33\% in average, and up to 72\% in special cases. Gather in-house dataset with 50k scenes, analyze and filter data. Developed DL models for predicting agent trajectories by incorporating HD maps and addressing uncertainty through multi-modal distribution. Deployed model in ROS2 node on self-driving car with average inference time 64ms per frame.}
